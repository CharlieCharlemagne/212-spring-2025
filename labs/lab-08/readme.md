# Lab 8 (04/09/2025)

The goal of this lab is to practice solving problems
using binary trees.  We strongly encourage you to work
on this lab in collaboration with your peers, but you are expected to
complete the code on your own, as
each student is expected to make an individual submission.

> [!WARNING]
> For this lab in particular, you are NOT ALLOWED to use LLMs (large language models)
> such as Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.  You are allowed to use the internet to look
> up syntax and other basic information, but you should not automatically
> generate code using LLMs.  If you have Copilot on your environment,
> please disable it for the duration of the lab.  Focus on understanding
> the concepts and writing the code yourself.

## Kattis problems

All problems are available via the 
[Kattis](https://uri.kattis.com/courses/CSC212/Spring25) platform. 
Problems are numbered from A to C, ordered by difficulty.

Each student, regardless of their section, will have 2 hours to
complete the problems.

## Submission

Once you are finished with the problems, you **must** submit 
the files listed below via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). 
Both Kattis and Gradescope will remain open 
until 4pm, but remember that you only have 2 hours to work on the problems.

The following files are required for submission, using the exact
filenames provided here:

- `problem-a.cpp`
- `problem-b.cpp`
- `problem-c.cpp`

The `.cpp` source files are your solutions to their respective problems. 
If you have partial solutions or solutions that were not accepted by
Kattis, you should still submit them.  For the problems you have 
NOT attempted, you DON"T need to submit a file.
